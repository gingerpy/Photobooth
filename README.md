# Photobooth

This is a very small Python script that is used to:
* move the pictures from the shared folder to your subfolder of htdocs to upload pictures to your local webserver (xampp)
* print pictures using a photoprinter (or any other printer connected to your computer)

I am using call commands because it was impossible to change the permissions on my netbook version of Windows XP.
